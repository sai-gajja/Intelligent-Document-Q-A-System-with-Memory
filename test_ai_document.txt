    Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. 
    These machines are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. 
    
    Key aspects of AI include:
    - Machine Learning: Systems that learn from data
    - Natural Language Processing: Understanding human language
    - Computer Vision: Interpreting visual information
    - Robotics: Physical systems that perform tasks
    
    MACHINE LEARNING

    Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data.
    There are three main types of machine learning:
    1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data
    2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
    3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through trial and error
    
    This document provides a basic overview of artificial intelligence concepts.
